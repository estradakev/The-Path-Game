# The-Path

------

This semester-long university assignment involved developing a simple video game using Codename One. The game features an ant as the player character, navigating a path while avoiding collisions with spiders and keeping the ant fed. The project's primary learning goal was to study object-oriented programming (OOP) design principles.

The game development process was broken down into three distinct parts. In the first part, the focus was on developing a solid initial class hierarchy and control structure. To aid in this process, a UML diagram was created to visually layout the structure and facilitate easier implementation.

The second part of the project involved incorporating various design patterns and a graphical user interface (GUI) into the game. Different design patterns were utilized to improve the overall design and functionality of the game, while the GUI added a user-friendly interface for players to interact with.

The final part of the project was centered around adding interactive graphics and animation techniques, such as collision detection and time-driven animation, to enhance the visual appeal and gameplay experience of the game. These additions required careful implementation and attention to detail.

Throughout the assignment, I gained valuable experience in object-oriented programming, software design, and game development. By completing the three parts of the project, I successfully achieved the learning goals of studying OOP design principles and created a fun and challenging video game using Codename One.
